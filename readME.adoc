.Description of the project
This project is a simple on and off push button that turns the LED on or off with each
push of the button. Simple circuit with the code doing the heavy lifting.

.Items Needed
* One Push button
* One 330 Ohm Resistor
* One Red LED
* One Arduino R3 
* One Breadboard
* Five jumper wires

.Circuit Design
On the breadboard I installed the one push button left legs at column 55 on the second part
of the breadboard, rows F, G, H, I, and J. The right legs in column 53. The 330 Ohm resistor
left leg into column 30 on the upper part of the breadboard, rows A, B, C, D, and E. With
the right leg into column 35. The red LED anode(positive leg, Long leg) into column 35, with
the cathode(short leg) into column 36. I then ran the jumper wires. From the Arduino pin 2
to column 55. Pin 4 to column 30. GND on the Arduino to GND rail on the breadboard. I ran 
from the GND rail to column 53. From GND rail to column 36. The circuit is now wired up.

.Code
The code for this project is in the file called "SimplePanio.ino".

.What To Expect
This project will take the button reading to see where it is to where it was. We
need to think about keeping track of the LED state also. We want the switching to happen
when the button has been pushed but is being let up to make the switch. In order to do this
we will have the if() look at the old button state and the new button state to see if the
button is switching the LED on or off. In the if() code block we will change the state of the
LED to have a nested if() to where we can ask if the LED is on (1) or off (0). Then if
off have to switch turn on. If on have the switch turn off. I found that adding a delay to 
the end of the loop cleans up the switch to allow it to respond with fast or slow presses.
